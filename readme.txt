A simple Spring DM test bundle. I'm able to deploy this successfully
in the Spring dm server by running

mvn package

and Deploying the resulting jar file via the local admin console at

http://localhost:8080/admin

Right now, the bundle does nothing save create a simple service which
returns a random number.
